## Overview

Cowan Simulation (CowanSim) is a prolific helicopter developer known for producing a diverse lineup of high-quality rotorcraft for both Microsoft Flight Simulator and X-Plane. The developer has built a reputation for creating accessible yet detailed helicopters that appeal to both casual flyers and serious rotorhead enthusiasts.

What distinguishes Cowan Simulation is their breadth of coverage—they've modeled everything from light training helicopters like the Robinson R22 to medium twins like the Bell 222B and Sikorsky S-76. Their products feature custom 3D modeled instruments, advanced sound design powered by Wwise (MSFS) and FMOD (X-Plane), and their proprietary Stability Augmentation System (SAS) with integrated autopilot modes.

The developer maintains an active presence across both major simulation platforms, ensuring that both MSFS and X-Plane users have access to quality helicopter content. Their commitment to detailed paint kits and multiple liveries also makes their aircraft popular with virtual operators and livery artists.

## History

Cowan Simulation began developing helicopter add-ons around 2015, initially focusing on X-Plane. The developer steadily built a portfolio of rotorcraft while establishing their reputation for quality modeling and systems simulation.

When Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 launched with helicopter support, Cowan Simulation was among the first developers to port their existing products to the new platform while also creating MSFS-native aircraft. This dual-platform approach allowed them to reach a broader audience while leveraging their existing development expertise.

Over the years, CowanSim has released over a dozen helicopter models, ranging from piston trainers to turbine utility aircraft, making them one of the most productive helicopter developers in the flight simulation space.
