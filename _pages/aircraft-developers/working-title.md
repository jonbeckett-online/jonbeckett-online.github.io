## Overview

Working Title is a collaborative development group that became legendary in the MSFS community for dramatically improving default aircraft and avionics. What began as a community modding effort evolved into one of the most influential forces in MSFS development, ultimately leading to Microsoft and Asobo integrating Working Title's improvements into the core simulator.

The team's work on the G1000 and G3000 avionics, along with their CJ4 improvements, set new standards for what was possible in MSFS aircraft systems. Their success demonstrated the value of community-driven development and established a model for how modding groups could positively influence the platform.

Several Working Title members were subsequently brought on board by Asobo to continue their work officially, representing one of the most successful community-to-official collaborations in flight simulation history.

## History

Working Title formed in 2020, shortly after MSFS 2020 released, when a group of developers recognized that the default aircraft avionics needed significant improvements. Their early work focused on enhancing the Garmin systems found in default aircraft.

The CJ4 became their showcase project, with Working Title transforming the default business jet into a vastly more capable and realistic aircraft. Their improvements to the G1000 and G3000 avionics were eventually adopted by Asobo for official integration.

In 2021, key Working Title members were hired by Asobo to continue this work as official contributors, a testament to the quality and impact of their community contributions.
