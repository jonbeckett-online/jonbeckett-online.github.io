## Overview

VirtualCol is a Colombian flight simulation developer specializing in regional aircraft that are often underrepresented in the simulation market. The company has carved out a unique niche by focusing on regional jets and turboprops, particularly those popular in Latin American and global regional airline operations. Their philosophy emphasizes bringing aircraft types to the simulation community that larger developers might overlook.

The developer has built a following among simmers who enjoy flying regional routes and want variety beyond the mainstream aircraft offerings. VirtualCol products tend to be positioned at accessible price points, making them attractive entry-level options for specific aircraft types.

## History

Founded in 2009, VirtualCol emerged from Colombia's flight simulation enthusiast community. The company initially focused on FSX add-ons, developing a catalog of regional aircraft that filled gaps in the marketplace. Their South American perspective influenced their aircraft selection, often prioritizing types commonly operated in that region.

As the flight simulation industry evolved, VirtualCol transitioned to newer platforms, releasing products for P3D and eventually MSFS. Their consistent focus on regional aircraft has made them a recognizable name in that segment of the market.

## Community Reputation

VirtualCol occupies a unique position in the flight simulation community. Their products are generally viewed as "budget-friendly" options that provide reasonable representations of regional aircraft. Reviews often note that while these add-ons may lack the depth of premium products, they offer good value for simmers wanting to fly aircraft types not available elsewhere.

Some community members appreciate VirtualCol for filling gaps in the market, while others note that systems depth and visual fidelity may not match more expensive alternatives. The company is recognized for their niche focus on regional aircraft and their willingness to develop types that larger studios avoid. Customer support and update frequency have been variable, but the accessible pricing remains a key draw for their target audience.
