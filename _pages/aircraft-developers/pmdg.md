## Overview

PMDG (Precision Manuals Development Group) is widely regarded as the gold standard in study-level airliner development for flight simulation. Founded by Robert S. Randazzo, PMDG has built an unparalleled reputation for producing aircraft add-ons with exceptional attention to detail, accurate flight dynamics, and comprehensive systems modeling that rival professional training devices.

The company's simulation products are used by individuals, pilots, and professional flight crews in nearly every country around the world. PMDG works with major aerospace companies and partners with some of the world's largest airlines to produce highly detailed airliner simulations capable of reproducing the complex world of the modern flight deck in finite detail.

PMDG operates as a global business with employees and contractors working in Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Russia, South Africa, The Netherlands, and the United States. Beyond software development, PMDG operates restored aircraft including a Douglas DC-3 and an SNJ-6 used for aviation outreach.

## History

PMDG was founded by Robert S. Randazzo in January 1998 (incorporated 1997). Originally conceived as a small technical publishing company, PMDG's first product was the 747-400PS1 User's Guide released in February 1998 to help non-pilots master the aircraft.

The company transitioned into aircraft development, launching the FS98 Series Aircraft Operating Manual product line. In August 1999, PMDG became the first software developer to formally announce support for Terminal Reality's FLY! simulator. Their Boeing 757-200ER for FLY! was released on December 18, 1999.

Over the years, PMDG developed legendary products for Flight Simulator 2004, FSX, and Prepar3D. In June 2021, they released the DC-6 as their first product for MSFS 2020, followed by the acclaimed 737 NG3 series beginning in May 2022. The 777-300ER for MSFS was released on June 25, 2024, marking their first widebody for the new platform.

## Notable Achievements

- Considered the benchmark for study-level airliner simulation quality
- Featured in Wall Street Journal coverage of flight simulation
- First third-party developer to bring a true study-level Boeing to MSFS 2020
- Products used by real-world pilots for familiarization and procedure practice
- Pioneer in detailed systems simulation dating back to the late 1990s
- The 737 NGX was revolutionary when released, setting new standards for the hobby

## Community Reputation

PMDG enjoys an exceptional reputation for quality, though their products come at premium pricing. The company is known for meticulous attention to detail, excellent flight dynamics, and systems depth that satisfies even real-world type-rated pilots. Customer support is handled through their dedicated forum and support portal. While the company's communication style (particularly founder Robert Randazzo's forum posts) has occasionally generated controversy, the quality of their products is rarely questioned. Their 737 for MSFS is considered by many to be the definitive rendition of the aircraft for home simulation.
