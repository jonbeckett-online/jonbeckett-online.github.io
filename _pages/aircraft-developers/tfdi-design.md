## Overview

TFDi Design is a flight simulation-focused technology and software development company operating under the ownership of Florida-registered corporation Invernyx, Inc. The company creates a variety of products revolving around bringing efficiency and modern technology into the flight simulation world, with a strong foundation in the virtual airline community.

While TFDi Design is known for multiple products including the smartCARS virtual airline management system, their flagship aircraft project is the McDonnell Douglas MD-11—a trijet airliner that has long been requested by the simulation community. This aircraft represents one of the most complex simulation projects undertaken for modern flight simulation platforms.

The company's mission is to create quality products through carefully planned and executed development, utilizing modern technology to push the limits of what is considered possible in flight simulation.

## History

TFDi Design was established in 2013, with the company building its reputation initially through the virtual airline community. Their smartCARS system became widely adopted by virtual airlines for tracking flights and managing pilot activities.

The company announced development of the MD-11 as their flagship aircraft project, generating significant anticipation as no other developer had attempted a study-level MD-11 for modern platforms. Development was a multi-year undertaking given the complexity of simulating a three-engine trijet with its unique systems.

The TFDi MD-11 was released for MSFS 2020 in 2024, becoming the first and only study-level MD-11 simulation for the platform. It was subsequently nominated for "Best Airliner" in community awards, validating years of development effort.

TFDi products are now available through multiple storefronts including the iniBuilds Store.

## Community Reputation

TFDi Design is well-regarded for taking on challenging projects that other developers have avoided. The MD-11 is particularly appreciated as it represents a unique aircraft type with no alternatives in the market—for anyone wanting to fly a trijet in MSFS, TFDi's MD-11 is the only option.

The aircraft received positive reviews upon release, with praise for the unique flying experience it provides. Flying a three-engine aircraft with its distinctive power management and flight characteristics offers something different from typical twin-engine airliners.

smartCARS maintains a strong reputation in the virtual airline community as reliable flight tracking software. The company provides support through their forum and maintains regular communication about development progress.

Pricing for the MD-11 is at the premium end of the market, but given its position as the only product of its type, users seeking this experience have been willing to pay for the quality delivered. The development timeline was longer than initially projected, but the end result has been praised for fulfilling the promise of a study-level trijet simulation.
