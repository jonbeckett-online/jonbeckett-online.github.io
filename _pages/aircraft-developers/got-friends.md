## Overview

Got Friends is a creative flight simulation developer that has distinguished itself by focusing on unusual, experimental, and niche aircraft that other developers typically overlook. From the outrageous modified Wilga known as "Draco X" to high-performance sailplanes and ultralight helicopters, Got Friends fills gaps in the MSFS marketplace with products that offer unique flying experiences.

The company has built a vibrant community around their products, centered on their active Discord server where pilots share experiences, organize group flights, and participate in weekly events. Their approach combines quality aircraft development with community engagement, creating a following that goes beyond simple customer relationships.

Got Friends products span an impressive range from STOL aircraft and gliders to warbirds and experimental designs, unified by a commitment to bringing interesting, flyable aircraft to the simulation rather than just another variant of common types.

## History

Got Friends emerged in 2020 following the launch of Microsoft Flight Simulator, quickly establishing themselves with their distinctive approach to aircraft selection. Rather than competing directly with established developers in popular aircraft categories, they identified underserved niches.

Their early success with gliders and experimental aircraft led to expansion into other categories including WWII warbirds, ultralights, and modified bush planes. The company has maintained a steady release schedule while building one of the more engaged communities in the MSFS ecosystem.
