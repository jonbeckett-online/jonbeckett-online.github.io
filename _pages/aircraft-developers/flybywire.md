## Overview

FlyByWire Simulations is a groundbreaking open-source project that has redefined what's possible in freeware flight simulation development. As a community-driven organization, FlyByWire brings together hundreds of contributors from around the world to develop high-fidelity aircraft for Microsoft Flight Simulator, completely free of charge.

The project began with an ambitious goal: to transform the default Asobo A320neo into a study-level aircraft. What emerged was the A32NX, one of the most downloaded and acclaimed freeware add-ons in flight simulation history. The project's success demonstrated that community collaboration could produce results rivaling commercial products.

With over 2 million downloads, 269+ contributors, and 5,177+ code commits, FlyByWire represents a remarkable achievement in community-driven development. The organization maintains complete transparency through their open-source model, allowing anyone to contribute code, report issues, or review development progress.

## History

FlyByWire Simulations was founded in 2020 shortly after the release of Microsoft Flight Simulator. The founding team recognized that while the default A320neo was visually impressive, its systems depth was limited compared to what serious virtual pilots expected.

The A32NX project started as a community modification to improve the default aircraft's systems. Over time, it evolved into a comprehensive overhaul featuring custom-coded fly-by-wire systems, realistic flight management computers, accurate autopilot logic, and detailed systems modeling.

In 2022, FlyByWire announced their most ambitious project yet: the A380X. This would be the first study-level simulation of the Airbus A380 superjumbo for any desktop flight simulator. Development of the A380X continues as a flagship project.

## Aircraft Portfolio

### Current Products (Free)
- **A32NX** - Enhanced Airbus A320neo featuring:
  - Custom fly-by-wire system
  - Realistic FMC with accurate performance calculations
  - Comprehensive autopilot and autothrust
  - Detailed electrical, hydraulic, and fuel systems
  - flyPadOS 3 Electronic Flight Bag
  - Regular updates via the FlyByWire Installer

### In Development
- **A380X** - Airbus A380 superjumbo airliner with study-level systems

### Distribution
All products are distributed free through the custom FlyByWire Installer, which provides easy access to different build versions (Stable, Development, Experimental).

## Notable Achievements

- Over 2 million downloads of the A32NX
- Largest open-source flight simulation project by contributor count
- Created the first truly study-level freeware airliner for modern MSFS
- Developed flyPadOS, a comprehensive Electronic Flight Bag system
- Active community with real-time flight tracking integration
- Transparent development with all code publicly available on GitHub

## Community Reputation

FlyByWire enjoys an extraordinary reputation within the flight simulation community. The A32NX is universally recommended as the first add-on any new MSFS user should install if interested in Airbus operations. The project demonstrates that freeware development can achieve quality levels competitive with commercial products.

The organization relies on donations through Open Collective to fund infrastructure costs such as download servers. They maintain complete transparency about how donated funds are used. The active Discord community provides support and allows users to interact directly with developers.

Some users note that the Development and Experimental builds occasionally have stability issues, but this is expected for cutting-edge development versions. The Stable builds are well-regarded for reliability. The upcoming A380X has generated significant anticipation as it will bring a completely new aircraft type to the simulation rather than modifying an existing default aircraft.
