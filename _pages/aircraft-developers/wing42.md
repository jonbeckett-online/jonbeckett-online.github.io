## Overview

Wing42 is a German flight simulation development studio known for creating exceptionally detailed reproductions of historic aircraft. Founded by a small team of passionate developers, Wing42 has carved out a unique niche in the flight simulation market by focusing on aircraft from aviation's pioneering era—machines that helped define the early days of powered flight.

What sets Wing42 apart is their "labor of love and passion" approach to development. They don't simply create flight simulation add-ons; they meticulously research every detail of their subjects, from the fabric-covered surfaces to the period-accurate instrumentation and navigation equipment. Their work often includes historically appropriate features such as authentic radio navigation systems that operated during the aircraft's era.

The company maintains an active social media presence and engages directly with their community through newsletters, development blogs, and responsive customer support channels.

## History

Wing42 was established in 2017 with a clear focus on early aviation history. Their first major release was the Lockheed Vega, a groundbreaking monoplane from the 1920s and 1930s that had been flown by aviation pioneers including Amelia Earhart.

The release of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 opened new opportunities for Wing42. They brought the Blériot XI to the new platform, followed by an extensively researched Boeing 247D that showcased their commitment to historical accuracy, including authentic "flying the beam" radio navigation simulation.
