## Overview

Hans Hartmann, operating as S&H Software (Simulation & Hardware Software), is a German developer renowned for creating some of the most detailed turboprop aircraft simulations available for flight simulators. Working closely with Aerosoft as a publishing partner, Hartmann has built a reputation for systems-deep aircraft that appeal to virtual pilots seeking authentic regional turboprop experiences.

The developer is particularly known for meticulous attention to accurate systems modeling, flight dynamics, and cockpit procedures. S&H Software products are designed for pilots who want to fly aircraft "by the book," with realistic startup procedures, systems management, and failure modeling.

## History

Hans Hartmann began developing flight simulation add-ons in the early 2000s, initially creating products for FS2004 and later FSX. His work gained recognition for its technical accuracy and depth, leading to a long-standing partnership with Aerosoft as publisher. This relationship has allowed S&H Software products to reach a wide audience while maintaining the quality standards that define the brand.

The developer's focus on turboprop aircraft—particularly the ATR and DHC-6 series—has made Hartmann a go-to name for pilots interested in regional and bush flying operations. The transition to MSFS has seen continued development of these signature aircraft types.

## Aircraft Portfolio

### Current Products
- **ATR 42-600** - Modern regional turboprop with comprehensive systems modeling
- **ATR 72-600** - Larger variant with detailed PW127 engine simulation
- **DHC-6 Twin Otter** - Iconic bush plane in collaboration with Aerosoft

### Legacy Products
- ATR 72-500 for FSX/P3D
- DHC-6 Twin Otter Series for FSX/P3D
- Various updates and expansions for the ATR family

## Notable Achievements

- Industry-leading ATR simulation for flight simulators
- Highly accurate turboprop engine and systems modeling
- Long-standing partnership with Aerosoft
- Detailed custom avionics implementations
- Praised by real-world ATR pilots for accuracy
- Comprehensive documentation and pilot handbooks

## Community Reputation

Hans Hartmann's products are consistently rated among the best turboprop simulations available. The ATR series, in particular, has earned acclaim for its authentic flight characteristics and systems depth. Real-world ATR pilots have praised the simulation's accuracy, which speaks to the development methodology employed.

The community appreciates the "study-level" approach taken with these aircraft, though this also means a steeper learning curve compared to simpler add-ons. Support and updates are handled through the Aerosoft partnership, providing users with access to forums and help desk resources. While pricing reflects the premium nature of these products, most users consider them excellent value given the depth and quality offered. S&H Software products are recommended for serious simmers who enjoy mastering complex aircraft systems.
