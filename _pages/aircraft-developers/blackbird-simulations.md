## Overview

Blackbird Simulations has established itself as a developer willing to tackle unusual and challenging aircraft that other developers avoid. Their portfolio spans from the massive CH-47D Chinook tandem-rotor helicopter to the iconic SR-71 Blackbird (which inspired their name), demonstrating technical versatility across radically different aircraft types.

What sets Blackbird Simulations apart is their focus on aircraft with unique operational characteristics. The Erickson S-64F Aircrane represents aerial firefighting and heavy-lift construction operations. The CH-47 Chinook brings tandem-rotor cargo operations. Their partnership with Miltech Simulations allows them to combine resources on ambitious military projects.

The developer embraces complexity, modeling aircraft that require pilots to understand specialized procedures and operational profiles. Whether it's sling-load operations with the Aircrane or the demanding flight characteristics of a Mach 3+ reconnaissance aircraft, Blackbird Simulations targets enthusiasts who want more than standard flying experiences.

## History

Blackbird Simulations emerged in 2021 during the expansion of MSFS third-party content. The developer's name pays homage to the legendary Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, signaling their interest in unique and high-performance aircraft.

Their early development focused on rotorcraft, with the CH-47D Chinook demonstrating their capability to model complex tandem-rotor dynamics. The Erickson S-64F Aircrane added specialized utility operations to their portfolio—an aircraft rarely modeled in consumer flight simulators.

A significant development was their partnership with Miltech Simulations, combining resources and expertise on military aviation projects. The A-1 Skyraider emerged from this collaboration, and the partnership continues to produce unique military aircraft for MSFS.

The SR-71A represents their most ambitious fixed-wing project—modeling the fastest air-breathing crewed aircraft ever built requires attention to unique aerodynamics, thermal dynamics, and systems unlike any other simulation challenge.

- Brings unique aircraft to flight simulation that wouldn't otherwise exist

## Community Reputation

Blackbird Simulations has earned respect for tackling aircraft that require significant development investment with limited mass-market appeal. The S-64F Aircrane, for example, appeals to a specific subset of helicopter enthusiasts interested in heavy-lift operations—but those enthusiasts are deeply grateful for its existence.

The CH-47 Chinook receives praise for capturing tandem-rotor handling, though some users note room for continued systems development. The SR-71A fulfills a long-standing wish among flight simmers for a quality Blackbird simulation.

Pricing is competitive, and the partnership with Miltech Simulations provides access to combined customer support resources. For simmers interested in operating genuinely unusual aircraft rather than another variation on common types, Blackbird Simulations offers compelling products. They're recommended for enthusiasts who want to fly something different and are willing to invest time learning specialized operations.
