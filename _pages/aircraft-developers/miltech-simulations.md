## Overview

Miltech Simulations has become the go-to developer for military rotorcraft and tiltrotor aircraft in Microsoft Flight Simulator. Their portfolio includes some of the most challenging and unique aircraft to model—the tandem-rotor CH-47 Chinook, the versatile MH-60 Black Hawk variant, and the revolutionary MV-22B Osprey tiltrotor.

What sets Miltech apart is their willingness to tackle aircraft that other developers avoid. The MV-22 Osprey, for example, requires modeling both helicopter and airplane flight regimes, along with the complex transition between them. Their CH-47 Chinook brings tandem-rotor dynamics to MSFS, offering a completely different flying experience from conventional helicopters.

The developer has established partnerships with other simulation companies, including Blackbird Simulations, to enhance their products and expand their reach. Their commitment to ongoing development is evident in their regular dev streams and active roadmap, which includes upcoming projects like the Bo 105 (in partnership with Project Stratosphere) and the CH-53E/MH-53E Super Stallion.

## History

Miltech Simulations was founded in 2020, coinciding with the launch of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. The developer recognized an opportunity to bring military rotorcraft to the burgeoning MSFS ecosystem, filling a gap left by developers focused on civil helicopters.

Their early releases established the company as a specialist in military aviation. The MH-60 brought the iconic Black Hawk to MSFS, while the MV-22B Osprey demonstrated their technical ambition by successfully implementing tiltrotor flight dynamics. The CH-47D Chinook added heavy-lift tandem rotor operations to their lineup.

The company has also expanded beyond helicopters into fixed-wing military aircraft, including the A-1 Skyraider attack aircraft. Looking forward, their announced projects include the Bo 105 (Q1 2026), U-2R/S reconnaissance aircraft, and the massive CH-53E/MH-53E Super Stallion heavy-lift helicopter.

## Community Reputation

Miltech Simulations is appreciated for bringing military rotorcraft to MSFS that wouldn't otherwise exist. Their products fill a specific niche for virtual military aviation enthusiasts. The MV-22 Osprey in particular is praised for successfully implementing tiltrotor operations, despite the complexity involved.

Pricing is competitive (£19-25 range), making military aviation accessible. The developer maintains active Discord and forum support, with responsive customer service (typically under 24 hours). Dev streams provide transparency about upcoming projects and ongoing development.

Community feedback on individual products is generally positive, though as with any developer tackling complex military aircraft, there are occasional requests for deeper systems simulation. The developer's willingness to update products for MSFS 2024 compatibility has been well-received.
