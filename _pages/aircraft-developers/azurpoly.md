## Overview

AzurPoly is a French flight simulation development studio specializing in aircraft with strong connections to French aviation heritage. The studio has established itself as a champion of French military and civilian aircraft in Microsoft Flight Simulator, bringing iconic designs from Dassault, SOCATA, and other French manufacturers to the simulation community.

What distinguishes AzurPoly is their ability to secure official licensing agreements with manufacturers, including partnerships with Dassault Aviation. This official backing enables access to accurate technical data and reference materials that result in highly authentic simulations. The studio's products reflect a deep appreciation for French aerospace achievements and a commitment to showcasing them in the virtual world.

AzurPoly demonstrates strong technical capabilities, producing nuanced flight models, immersive cockpits, and deep systems simulation. Their work on the SEPECAT Jaguar and C-160 Transall has established them as a serious developer capable of handling complex military aircraft.

## History

AzurPoly launched with the Fouga CM.170 Magister in early 2022, immediately demonstrating their focus on French aviation. The Magister served as the primary jet trainer for the French Air Force and was used by the Patrouille de France aerobatic team, making it a symbolically significant debut.

The studio followed with the SOCATA TB-30 Epsilon trainer in mid-2022, then expanded into larger and more complex aircraft. The C-160 Transall military transport released in 2023 marked their first major cargo aircraft and was followed by the SEPECAT Jaguar strike fighter with an official Dassault license.

In 2025, AzurPoly announced their most ambitious project yet: the Dassault Rafale, developed under official license from Dassault Aviation in partnership with JFEXP.
