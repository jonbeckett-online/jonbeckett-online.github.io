## Hello, I'm Jonathan — nice to meet you!

In the daytime I'm a software and web developer for a Microsoft partner, working on huge corporate systems that I can rarely tell anybody anything about. In my spare time—among other things—I tinker with flight simulation software and record my idiot escapades on YouTube.

**Disclaimer: I'm not a real pilot.** The virtual skies are safer that way.

## The Virtual Cockpit

When not wrestling with enterprise codebases, you'll find me attempting to fly all manner of simulated aircraft in a questionably correct manner. I share these adventures with an amazing community:

- **[YouTube](https://youtube.com/@jonbeckett)** — Nearly 50,000 fellow virtual aviators follow along with my flight sim escapades and livestreams
- **[Substack Blog](https://jonbeckett.substack.com/)** — 2000+ subscribers read about my many and varied adventures across much of the known (virtual) world
- **[Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/jonbeckett)** — Where you can grab my startup procedures and guides for aircraft like the A310, MD-11, A350, Eurofighter Typhoon, and more

I've created resources for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, including startup procedures, checklists, and guides like the Garmin G1000 Flight Plan Programming reference that's helped hundreds of virtual pilots.

## Get In Touch
