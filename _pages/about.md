## Hello, I'm Jonathan — nice to meet you!

In the daytime I'm a software and web developer for a Microsoft partner, working on huge corporate systems that I can rarely tell anybody anything about. In my spare time I tinker with flight simulation software and record my escapades on YouTube.

Here's where you can find me:

- **[YouTube](https://youtube.com/@jonbeckett)** — Nearly 50,000 fellow virtual aviators follow along with my flight sim escapades and livestreams
- **[Substack](https://jonbeckett.substack.com/)** — 2000+ subscribers read about my many and varied adventures across much of the known (virtual) world
- **[Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/jonbeckett)** — Thousands of people use my guides and startup procedures to help them get started with Flight Simulator and X-Plane. For a full list, visit the [Procedures and Guides](/resources/procedures-and-guides/) page.
