## Overview

FlightSim Studio (FSS) is a relatively new but ambitious developer focused on bringing underrepresented aircraft types to Microsoft Flight Simulator. The company has made a significant impact with two major projects: the Boeing 727 and the Embraer E-Jets series, both of which represent aircraft types that were previously unavailable in study-level form for MSFS.

What distinguishes FlightSim Studio is their willingness to tackle challenging projects that other developers have avoided. The Boeing 727 trijet and the Embraer regional jet family are complex aircraft requiring significant development investment, yet FSS has committed to delivering detailed simulations of both.

The company represents the new generation of MSFS developers, leveraging the platform's modern capabilities to create detailed aircraft simulations that would have been difficult to achieve on older platforms.

## History

FlightSim Studio was established in 2021 to develop add-on aircraft for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The company announced two major projects early in their existence: the Boeing 727 and the Embraer E-Jets series.

The Boeing 727 project was particularly notable as this iconic trijet had been absent from desktop simulation for years. The 727 served airlines worldwide from the 1960s through the 2000s and remains beloved by aviation enthusiasts, yet no developer had produced a study-level version for modern platforms.

The Embraer E-Jets project aims to bring the E170, E175, E190, and E195 regional jets to MSFS. These aircraft are workhorses of regional aviation worldwide, particularly in North America, and represent another significant gap in the available aircraft roster.

## Aircraft Portfolio

- Committed to developing the complete Embraer E-Jets family
- Addressed significant gaps in available aircraft types for MSFS
- Demonstrated capability for complex trijet systems simulation
- Built anticipation in the community for underserved aircraft types

## Community Reputation

FlightSim Studio has earned respect for their ambitious project selections. The Boeing 727 was warmly received by the community as it finally provided access to this classic trijet in modern simulation. The aircraft offers a unique flying experience distinct from contemporary twins.

The Embraer E-Jets project has generated significant anticipation, as these aircraft are extremely popular with aviation enthusiasts but had no representation in MSFS. Many users fly regional routes and have been eager for quality regional jet options beyond turboprops.

As a newer developer, FSS is still building their track record, but initial products have been well-received. The company maintains communication through their website and community channels about development progress.

Pricing for FlightSim Studio products is competitive with the market for study-level aircraft. For users seeking unique aircraft experiences beyond the standard Boeing and Airbus narrow-body offerings, FSS represents an exciting developer to watch as they continue to bring underserved aircraft types to MSFS.
