## Overview

Golden Age Simulations (GAS) was a veteran flight simulation developer with nearly 20 years of experience creating aircraft models for the flight simulation community. Specializing in classic and vintage aircraft, particularly biplanes from aviation's early decades, GAS earned a dedicated following among enthusiasts of classic aviation.

The company was known for their Boeing Stearman variants, which became their signature products. These classic biplanes, originally used as military trainers during World War II, remain popular with real-world pilots and aviation enthusiasts alike, making them natural choices for detailed simulation.

**Important Note:** Golden Age Simulations announced in early 2025 that they would cease operations effective June 30, 2025. While existing customers can still access their purchase history through vendors like Just Flight, SimMarket, and the Microsoft Marketplace, no new sales are being made.
