## Overview

iniBuilds is a cutting-edge game studio that has rapidly grown to become one of the most prolific and respected names in flight simulation. Headquartered in London, the company specializes in the design and development of high-fidelity aircraft and airport sceneries for simulation, while also providing commercial outsourcing services to the wider gaming and training industry.

Standing at the forefront of the flight simulation industry, iniBuilds is fueled by a driven team and passionate community. The company has expanded beyond their own products to operate a major marketplace (the iniBuilds Store) where third-party developers can sell their add-ons, making them a central hub for the flight simulation community.

iniBuilds represents a new generation of flight simulation developers, combining modern development practices with deep technical expertise. Their aircraft products feature detailed systems modeling, quality visual design, and regular updates based on community feedback.

## History

The company name stems from their inception in early 2019, when they began creating modifications for Prepar3D. The unusual name comes from an "ini file" of a GSX Profile, which was their first project, combined with "Builds" from "building a profile."

From those humble beginnings creating liveries and dynamic lighting enhancements, iniBuilds quickly moved to developing comprehensive solutions for flight simulators. Their first major aircraft project was the A300-600R for X-Plane, which showcased their capability for complex systems simulation.

With the release of MSFS 2020, iniBuilds pivoted to become a major player on the new platform. They released the A310 as a default aircraft inclusion through partnership with Microsoft/Asobo, and have since expanded their lineup to include numerous Airbus widebody aircraft and world-class airport sceneries.

## Community Reputation

iniBuilds has built a strong reputation for producing quality products at reasonable prices. Their aircraft are generally praised for visual quality, systems depth, and value proposition. The company maintains active communication through their forum and social media channels.

The iniBuilds Store has become a popular alternative marketplace to competitors, offering a curated selection of third-party products alongside their own. Some developers appreciate their marketplace terms and customer reach.

While individual products have received varying reviews (some preferring Fenix for the A320 space, for example), iniBuilds is respected for their ambitious scope and consistent output. Their willingness to tackle unique aircraft types like the A340 and An-225 has earned them appreciation from enthusiasts seeking variety beyond the typical Boeing/Airbus narrow-body offerings.
