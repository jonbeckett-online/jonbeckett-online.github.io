## Overview

Just Flight is one of the oldest and most established names in flight simulation, with nearly three decades of experience developing and publishing software for virtual aviators. Beginning as a company named "The Associates" in 1995, Just Flight has grown into one of the world's largest developers and publishers of flight simulation software.

The company is renowned for their diverse portfolio spanning multiple aircraft types, from classic propliners to modern regional jets. Their talented in-house development team has produced some of the community's best-loved add-ons, while they also publish products from trusted third-party developers.

Just Flight's approach combines quality with accessibility—their products are known for being well-documented, reasonably priced, and supported by responsive customer service. Their sister company, Just Trains, serves the train simulation community.

## History

Just Flight began in 1995 as The Associates, founded to supply the emerging market of flight simulation enthusiasts with quality software. The combination of top-quality programs, realistic pricing, and efficient service proved successful, and within several years the Just Flight name was firmly established as a trusted brand.

Through the FS98, FS2000, FS2002, FS2004, FSX, and P3D eras, Just Flight consistently delivered quality products. Their catalog has included everything from classic aircraft like the DC-3 to modern regional jets, general aviation aircraft, and scenery packages.

With the release of MSFS 2020, Just Flight quickly became one of the most active publishers on the new platform, bringing both new products and updated versions of classics. Their portfolio for MSFS continues to expand with regular new releases.
