## Overview

Sim Skunk Works is an Italian flight simulation developer specializing in recreating classic Italian and European military aircraft. The studio takes its name from Lockheed Martin's legendary Skunk Works advanced development division, reflecting their aspiration to bring innovative and detailed aircraft to the simulation community. Their focus on Italian aviation heritage sets them apart from developers concentrating on more commonly simulated American or Soviet aircraft.

The studio is known for meticulous attention to authentic flight dynamics and systems representation, particularly for Cold War-era European aircraft that receive less attention from larger developers. Their work preserves the legacy of important but lesser-known aircraft that shaped European military aviation.

Sim Skunk Works products appeal to enthusiasts interested in exploring aviation history beyond the usual F-16s and F-14s, offering experiences with aircraft that many simmers may never have encountered.

## History

Sim Skunk Works began developing aircraft for FSX and Prepar3D before transitioning to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. The studio built its reputation with careful recreations of Italian Air Force aircraft, filling a niche that larger developers typically overlook.

The TF-104G Starfighter project demonstrated their commitment to authentic simulation of challenging aircraft—the F-104 was notorious for its demanding handling characteristics and high accident rate. Sim Skunk Works' implementation captures both the exhilarating performance and the unforgiving nature of the "Widowmaker."

## Aircraft Portfolio

### Current Products
- **Fiat G.91** - Italian-designed NATO light fighter-bomber
- **SIAI-Marchetti SF.260** - Military trainer and light attack aircraft
- **TF-104G Starfighter** - Two-seat trainer version of the legendary "Missile with a Man in It"

### Aircraft Details

**Fiat G.91:** The G.91 was designed as a NATO light ground attack fighter and served with the Italian and German air forces. Sim Skunk Works' version captures the nimble handling and period-correct avionics of this important Cold War design.

**SF.260:** This elegant trainer has served military and civilian operators worldwide. The simulation includes accurate flight characteristics that explain why the aircraft remains popular for aerobatic training.

**TF-104G Starfighter:** The F-104 represented the ultimate expression of 1950s "higher and faster" philosophy. The TF-104G two-seat variant allowed for training on this demanding aircraft, and Sim Skunk Works' version includes the challenging flight envelope that earned the Starfighter its notorious reputation.

## Notable Achievements

- Comprehensive recreation of the F-104 Starfighter's challenging flight characteristics
- Preservation of Italian aviation heritage through detailed simulations
- Successful transition from legacy platforms to MSFS

## Community Reputation

Sim Skunk Works maintains a solid reputation among enthusiasts interested in European and Italian military aviation. The studio is appreciated for tackling aircraft that other developers ignore, providing experiences unavailable elsewhere. Their TF-104G Starfighter is particularly valued by those seeking the challenge of mastering one of aviation's most demanding aircraft.

Users praise the authentic flight models and period-appropriate systems representations. The niche focus means smaller community discussion compared to developers producing mainstream fighters, but those who discover Sim Skunk Works products typically become dedicated fans.

The studio is seen as a passionate project driven by genuine enthusiasm for the aircraft rather than market considerations, resulting in products that capture the character of their subjects authentically.
