## Overview

Leonardo Software House is an Italian developer renowned for their exceptional simulation of the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 series, marketed under the "Fly The Maddog" brand. For nearly two decades, they have been the definitive source for anyone wishing to experience this classic twinjet in desktop flight simulation.

The MD-80 series, affectionately known as the "Mad Dog" in aviation circles, was a workhorse of many airlines from the 1980s through the 2010s. Leonardo Software House captured the essence of this aircraft with meticulous attention to the unique characteristics that made the MD-80 beloved by pilots—from its distinctive cockpit layout to its handling qualities.

The company represents a specialist approach to flight simulation development, focusing their expertise on one aircraft family rather than spreading across multiple types. This focus has resulted in what is widely considered the definitive MD-80 simulation for desktop platforms.

## History

Leonardo Software House was founded in 2006 by developers passionate about recreating classic airliners for flight simulation. They identified the MD-80 as an underserved aircraft type in the simulation market, despite its historical significance and continued real-world operation.

The original "Fly The Maddog" was released for FS2004, immediately establishing Leonardo as specialists in MD-80 simulation. The product featured accurate systems, realistic flight characteristics, and attention to the unique aspects of Mad Dog operations.

"Fly The Maddog X" followed for FSX, and "Maddog X for P3D" brought the aircraft to the Prepar3D platform. Each iteration improved upon the last, refining systems accuracy and taking advantage of new platform capabilities.

The MD-80 series (including MD-81, MD-82, MD-83, and MD-88 variants) represented some of the last products developed for the older FSX/P3D platforms as the community transitioned to MSFS.

## Aircraft Portfolio

## Community Reputation

Leonardo Software House is highly regarded within the specialist community of classic airliner enthusiasts. For anyone wanting to fly the MD-80 in simulation, Fly The Maddog is essentially the only serious option and is considered excellent at what it does.

The company receives praise for their dedication to accuracy and their passion for the MD-80. Real-world MD-80 pilots have vouched for the simulation's authenticity. The aircraft offers a unique flying experience different from modern Airbus or Boeing types, appealing to pilots who enjoy more hands-on flying.

The main limitation is platform availability—as of now, the product is not available for MSFS 2020/2024, limiting the audience to those still using P3D or FSX. There has been community hope for an MSFS version, but no official announcements have been made. For P3D users seeking classic airliner experiences, Fly The Maddog remains an essential addition to any virtual hangar.
