## Overview

Aeroplane Heaven is a UK-based flight simulation developer specializing in vintage and classic aircraft. They have established themselves as one of the premier developers for reproducing aircraft from aviation's golden age, with particular expertise in warbirds and classic general aviation aircraft from the 1930s through 1960s.

The company is known for producing highly detailed models with authentic flight characteristics that appeal to both casual simmers and serious aviation enthusiasts. Their aircraft feature detailed cockpits, period-accurate systems, and carefully researched exterior models based on extensive documentation and, where possible, access to actual preserved aircraft.

Aeroplane Heaven has forged partnerships with major publishers including Just Flight, allowing their products to reach a wide audience across multiple flight simulation platforms.

## History

Founded in 2010, Aeroplane Heaven began developing add-ons for FSX before expanding to Prepar3D and later Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. The company quickly gained recognition for their attention to historical accuracy and visual quality.

Their breakthrough products included classic aircraft such as the Cessna 140 and various World War II era aircraft. When MSFS 2020 launched, Aeroplane Heaven was among the early developers to bring vintage aircraft to the new platform, with their Douglas DC-3 becoming one of their most successful releases.
