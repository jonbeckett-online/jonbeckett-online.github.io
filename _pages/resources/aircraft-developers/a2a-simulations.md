## Overview

A2A Simulations is widely considered one of the most prestigious names in flight simulation development, renowned for creating ultra-realistic general aviation aircraft that set the standard for systems depth and flight dynamics. Founded by Scott Gentile, the company has built its reputation on the proprietary Accu-Sim technology, which simulates aircraft behavior at an unprecedented level of detail.

Accu-Sim goes beyond traditional simulation by modeling individual aircraft components, wear and tear, oil consumption, engine temperatures, and even the consequences of pilot abuse. Each aircraft develops its own "personality" over time based on how it's flown and maintained. Real-world pilots frequently praise A2A products as the closest experience to flying the actual aircraft without leaving the ground.

The company has expanded beyond consumer simulation to provide products for both hobbyist and professional/military flight training, while maintaining their commitment to uncompromising quality over quantity.

## History

A2A Simulations began in 2003 as Shockwave Productions, initially focused on visual effects for Combat Flight Simulator 3. Founder Scott Gentile, together with artist Robert Rogalski, created the award-winning "FirePower" add-on for CFS3.

The company rebranded to A2A Simulations after confusion with an unrelated online gaming service. In 2008, they unveiled Accu-Sim technology, representing a major leap forward in aircraft simulation fidelity. They developed a line of legendary aircraft for FSX and P3D including the C172, C182, Cherokee 180, and various warbirds.

With the release of MSFS 2020, A2A brought their Accu-Sim technology to the new platform, releasing the Comanche 250 and Aerostar 600 to critical acclaim, with native MSFS 2024 versions following.
