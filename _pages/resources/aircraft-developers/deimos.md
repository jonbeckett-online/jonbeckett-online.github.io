## Overview

Deimos (also known as Deimos Inc. or DeimoS) is a prolific developer primarily distributing through the Microsoft Flight Simulator Marketplace. The studio has built an extensive catalog of military aircraft spanning multiple nations and eras, from WWII propeller aircraft to modern fifth-generation jets. Their business model emphasizes quantity and accessibility, delivering a wide range of aircraft at budget-friendly prices.

While Deimos products fill gaps in the marketplace for aircraft types that premium developers haven't addressed, they occupy a distinct tier in terms of simulation depth. The studio prioritizes visual appeal and basic flight characteristics over complex systems modeling or deeply authentic cockpits. This approach makes their aircraft suitable for casual military flying without the learning curve of study-level simulations.

The developer has also expanded into airport scenery, producing packages for locations like Nice-Côte d'Azur (LFMN) and Milan Malpensa (LIMC).

## History

Deimos emerged early in the MSFS 2020 era and rapidly expanded their catalog through consistent marketplace releases. The studio gained attention with their MiG-29 Fulcrum and Su-57 Felon releases, which brought Russian military aircraft to MSFS when few alternatives existed.

Their development pace has been remarkable, releasing numerous aircraft across diverse categories—from the PC-21 trainer to the JAS-39 Gripen to the A-6 Intruder. This output has made them one of the most prolific military aircraft developers for MSFS, though at quality levels that generate mixed community responses.

Recent releases have included the Su-27 Flanker, F-5 Tiger, and various WWII aircraft including the Yak-9 and MiG-3.

## Community Reputation

Deimos occupies a polarizing position in the MSFS community. Their aircraft are frequently described as "budget" options—functional for basic military flying but lacking the depth and polish of premium developers like IndiaFoxtEcho or DC Designs. Community members advise watching reviews before purchasing and note significant variation in quality across products.

The Su-27 Flanker is generally considered their strongest military jet release, with users reporting satisfaction despite acknowledged limitations in systems depth. Other products like the Su-57 and Gripen receive more critical assessments, with common complaints about flight model issues, limited cockpit functionality, and basic visual quality.

For simmers seeking affordable entry points to aircraft types not available from premium developers, Deimos products serve a purpose. However, community consensus suggests tempering expectations and treating these as casual arcade-style experiences rather than serious simulations. The developer's airport scenery products receive similarly mixed reviews with comparisons to budget competitors.
