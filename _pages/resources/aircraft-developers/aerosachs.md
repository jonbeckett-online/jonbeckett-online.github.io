## Overview

AeroSachs began as a virtual aeroclub for general aviation enthusiasts and has evolved to become a developer of Tecnam light aircraft for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Based in Italy with their virtual hub at Marina di Campo (LIRJ) on the island of Elba, the project combines community flying with add-on development.

The company emphasizes that they are a "club and not an airline"—their focus is on bringing together pilots passionate about VFR and IFR general aviation flying while creating authentic simulations of real-world Tecnam aircraft. Their products cater to pilots who appreciate light sport and ultralight aircraft, providing accessible options for casual and training-focused flying.

AeroSachs operates on the IVAO network and organizes regular group flights, combining their role as developers with active participation in the online flying community.

## History

AeroSachs was established around 2020 with the goal of uniting flight simulation enthusiasts interested in general aviation. What started as a virtual flying club expanded into aircraft development as members sought to add authentic Italian light aircraft to their virtual hangars.

The club operates weekly flying sessions on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evenings (Italian time), often broadcast live on YouTube. Their progression system allows members to advance through increasingly capable aircraft as they log flights and demonstrate competence.
