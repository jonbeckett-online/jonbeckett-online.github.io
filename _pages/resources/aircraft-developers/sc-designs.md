## Overview

SC Designs operates as a sister studio to DC Designs, both based in the United Kingdom and focused on military aircraft for Microsoft Flight Simulator. While sharing resources and expertise with DC Designs, SC Designs maintains its own product identity and handles specific aircraft projects independently. The studio is best known for their F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-5E Tiger II add-ons.

The relationship between SC Designs and DC Designs allows for shared development knowledge while enabling each studio to focus on different aircraft types. SC Designs tends to handle projects that complement rather than compete with DC Designs' lineup, creating a broader portfolio of military jets across both labels.

Like their parent studio, SC Designs products are aimed at simmers seeking enjoyable military flying experiences at accessible price points, rather than study-level simulation depth.

## History

SC Designs was established as an extension of the DC Designs brand to handle additional military aircraft projects. The F-16 Fighting Falcon was their first major release, filling a significant gap in the MSFS military aircraft marketplace. The aircraft proved popular despite competition from other F-16 offerings.

The 2023 DC Designs roadmap indicated SC Designs would handle the C-17 Globemaster III project, demonstrating the studios' collaborative approach to expanding their military aircraft offerings. The F-5E Tiger II release in 2024 added a popular lightweight fighter to their catalog.

## Aircraft Portfolio

## Notable Achievements

- First comprehensive F-16 package for MSFS marketplace

## Community Reputation

SC Designs receives mixed but generally positive reviews. Their F-16 is appreciated for filling an important gap in the MSFS marketplace and providing an accessible entry point to Viper flying. The F-5E Tiger II release garnered praise for its flight model, though some community members noted visual quality differences compared to competing products.

Community discussions often compare SC Designs products to alternatives from Deimos and other developers. Users note that SC Designs aircraft prioritize flight model accuracy over cockpit detail, making them suitable for those focused on the flying experience rather than systems operation. Like DC Designs, pricing is generally considered reasonable for the level of simulation offered.

The studio benefits from the established DC Designs customer base and distribution channels, ensuring products reach a wide audience through the MSFS marketplace and third-party retailers.
