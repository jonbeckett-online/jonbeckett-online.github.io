## Overview

Black Square is a boutique flight simulation developer that has made a name for itself by creating "Analog" versions of existing aircraft in Microsoft Flight Simulator. Rather than developing aircraft from scratch, Black Square takes the default or third-party airframes and adds comprehensive analog instrumentation, enhanced systems simulation, and period-correct avionics that transform them into study-level experiences.

The company's philosophy centers on the belief that many pilots—both real and virtual—prefer traditional steam gauge cockpits over modern glass panels. Their modifications go far beyond simple cosmetic changes, incorporating realistic engine management, failure systems, and the kind of systems depth typically associated with study-level aircraft.

Black Square has earned a devoted following among simmers who appreciate the challenge and immersion of flying without GPS and glass cockpit automation, focusing instead on fundamental airmanship and navigation skills.

## History

Black Square emerged in 2021, shortly after the release of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. The developer quickly gained attention with their Analog TBM 850, which transformed the default TBM 930 into a more realistic, steam-gauge-equipped variant based on the earlier TBM 850 model.

The concept proved popular, and Black Square expanded to create analog versions of other aircraft including the Beechcraft King Air 350i and the Beechcraft piston twins. Their approach filled a gap in the market for pilots seeking challenging, traditional cockpit experiences.

## Aircraft Portfolio

### Current Products
- **Analog TBM 850** - Transforms the default TBM 930 into a steam-gauge TBM 850 with realistic systems
- **Analog King Air 350i** - Comprehensive analog cockpit conversion with enhanced systems depth
- **Analog Baron** - Beechcraft Baron B58 with traditional instrumentation and enhanced engine management
- **Analog Bonanza** - Beechcraft A36 Bonanza converted to full analog operations

### Key Features Across Products
- Traditional six-pack instrument layouts
- Realistic autopilot systems (KFC 225, etc.)
- Enhanced engine and systems simulation
- Period-correct avionics (KNS 80, DME, ADF)
- Comprehensive failure simulation
- Detailed pilot operating handbooks

## Notable Achievements

- Pioneered the "analog conversion" concept for MSFS
- Created some of the most systems-deep piston and turboprop aircraft for the platform
- Strong integration with popular avionics add-ons
- Detailed documentation and operating procedures

## Community Reputation

Black Square is highly regarded within the serious simmer community. Their products are often described as "study-level" and appeal particularly to real-world pilots and those seeking challenging, realistic flying experiences. The attention to systems detail and the focus on traditional navigation methods has earned them a loyal following. Pricing is at the premium end, but customers generally feel the depth and quality justify the cost. Support is responsive and the developer actively engages with the community for feedback and improvements.
