## Overview

BlueMesh (sometimes associated with the Big Tire Studio brand) is a newer entrant to the flight simulation development scene, focusing on gliders, ultralights, and experimental aircraft for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The developer addresses an often-underserved segment of the market, bringing aircraft that emphasize pure flying skill over complex systems management.

Their approach centers on aircraft that reward stick-and-rudder skills and offer unique flying experiences unavailable from mainstream developers. Gliders and ultralight aircraft require a fundamentally different mindset than powered flight—managing energy, reading the air, and making the most of atmospheric conditions.

Though relatively new to the scene, BlueMesh has already gained positive attention for the quality and authenticity of their releases.

## History

BlueMesh appeared on the flight simulation scene in late 2024, making their debut with the Fouga Castel C-25 S training glider. This release demonstrated a focus on classic European glider designs and a commitment to quality that earned early positive reviews.

The developer maintains a presence on Flightsim.to and related platforms, building a following among glider and ultralight enthusiasts.

## Aircraft Portfolio

### Current Products
- **Fouga Castel C-25 S** - Classic French training glider designed for beginner and intermediate pilots, emphasizing simplicity and reliability with robust construction

### Planned/In Development
- Additional gliders and ultralight aircraft expected

## Notable Achievements

- Successfully launched in a niche category (gliders) often ignored by larger developers
- 100% 5-star review rating on releases
- Growing follower base within the first months of operation
- Focus on historically significant training aircraft

## Community Reputation

Though still establishing themselves, BlueMesh has earned positive early impressions from the flight simulation community. Their focus on gliders fills a genuine gap in the MSFS ecosystem, and the quality of their initial release suggests promising development to come.

The glider community, while smaller than powered aircraft enthusiasts, is passionate and appreciative of developers who cater to their interests. BlueMesh's decision to focus on this niche positions them well to become a go-to source for soaring simulation.

For pilots interested in the pure challenge of unpowered flight—reading thermals, ridge soaring, and cross-country gliding—BlueMesh represents a welcome addition to the developer community. Early products suggest attention to authentic flight characteristics and appropriate visual quality for the price point.
