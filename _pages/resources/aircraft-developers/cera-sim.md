## Overview

Cera Sim is a specialized helicopter developer known for creating military and utility rotorcraft for flight simulators. Their flagship product, the Mil Mi-17, represents one of the most detailed recreations of former Soviet/Russian helicopter technology available in flight simulation.

What distinguishes Cera Sim is their focus on helicopters that are underrepresented in the simulation market. While many developers concentrate on Western helicopter types, Cera Sim brings Eastern European and military rotorcraft to virtual pilots who want to experience these unique machines.

The company maintains an ongoing development philosophy, with regular updates that improve flight dynamics, fix reported issues, and add new features to their existing products.

## History

Cera Sim was established around 2019, initially developing helicopters for Prepar3D before expanding to Microsoft Flight Simulator. Their experience with the complex systems and flight dynamics of military helicopters carried over effectively as they adapted their products for the new platform.

The Mi-17 has been the cornerstone of their MSFS offerings, receiving continuous updates to improve the flight experience. The company has since expanded to include Bell helicopters and the Sikorsky UH-60L Black Hawk.
