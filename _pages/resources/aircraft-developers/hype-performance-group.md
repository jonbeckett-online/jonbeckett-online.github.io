## Overview

Hype Performance Group (HPG) has established itself as the premier helicopter developer for Microsoft Flight Simulator, setting the benchmark for rotorcraft simulation quality. The team specializes exclusively in Airbus Helicopters products, bringing an unprecedented level of systems depth and flight model accuracy to the desktop simulation community.

What sets HPG apart is their commitment to professional-grade simulation. Their helicopters feature fully functional Helionix avionics suites, authentic flight dynamics developed with input from real-world pilots, and attention to detail that rivals professional training devices. The team has earned a reputation for continuous improvement, with regular updates that add features and refine existing systems.

HPG's work represents what many consider the gold standard for helicopter simulation in MSFS. Their products are frequently cited as examples of what's possible when talented developers push the boundaries of the platform's helicopter simulation capabilities.

## History

Founded in 2019, HPG emerged during the early days of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 development. The team recognized an opportunity to fill a gap in the market for high-fidelity helicopter add-ons that could match the quality of fixed-wing aircraft from developers like PMDG.

Their debut product, the H145, was released in 2021 and immediately set new standards for helicopter simulation in MSFS. The H135 followed, offering a lighter and more nimble alternative. The team continued expanding their Airbus Helicopters lineup with the H160 (a next-generation medium helicopter) and the heavy H225 Super Puma, giving simmers access to the full range of modern Airbus rotorcraft.

Each release has demonstrated HPG's iterative development philosophy—initial releases are polished and functional, with subsequent updates adding depth such as HEMS mission equipment, cargo hook operations, and enhanced weather integration.

## Community Reputation

HPG enjoys an exceptional reputation within the flight simulation community. Their products are consistently rated among the highest quality add-ons available for MSFS, with particular praise for systems depth, flight dynamics, and ongoing support. While their products command premium prices (typically €50-70), the community generally considers them excellent value given the quality delivered. Support is responsive, and the developer maintains active communication through Discord and forums. Many helicopter enthusiasts consider at least one HPG product essential for any serious MSFS rotorcraft collection.
