## Overview

Nemeth Designs is a veteran helicopter developer with roots stretching back to the FSX era, bringing nearly two decades of experience to their craft. The team specializes in creating quality helicopter simulations at accessible price points, making rotorcraft flying available to simmers who might find premium products out of reach.

What distinguishes Nemeth Designs is their focus on training and light helicopters that form the foundation of real-world pilot education. The Schweizer S300CBi and Hiller UH-12B are both aircraft commonly used for primary helicopter training, giving virtual pilots authentic platforms to learn fundamental rotorcraft skills. These aircraft feature honest flight models that don't hide the challenges of helicopter flying.

The developer has successfully bridged the transition from legacy simulators to MSFS while maintaining support for their older products. Their entire MSFS product line has been updated for MSFS 2024 compatibility, demonstrating their commitment to keeping products current.

## History

Nemeth Designs was established around 2008 during the peak of the FSX era. Founded by Tamas Nemeth, the company built its reputation creating helicopter add-ons for FSX and later Prepar3D. Over the years, they developed an extensive catalog of rotorcraft, from light trainers to military attack helicopters.

When Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 launched, Nemeth Designs transitioned to the new platform, bringing their development expertise to MSFS. Their initial MSFS releases focused on training helicopters—the Schweizer S300CBi and Hiller UH-12B—establishing their niche in the new ecosystem.

The company has maintained their legacy products while continuing to develop for modern platforms. Their July 2025 update brought MSFS 2024 compatibility to their entire product line, ensuring customers have access to their aircraft on the latest platform.
