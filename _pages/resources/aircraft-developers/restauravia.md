## Overview

Restauravia is a French flight simulation developer with deep expertise in recreating classic French aviation history. The company focuses on aircraft that hold special significance in French aviation heritage, from World War I-era bombers to post-war trainers and military jets. Their name, combining "restoration" and "aviation," reflects their mission to preserve and celebrate French aviation history through simulation.

What makes Restauravia distinctive is their access to actual preserved aircraft and their connections within the French vintage aviation community. Many of their models are based on detailed measurements and documentation from aircraft in French aviation museums and private collections, resulting in exceptional accuracy.

The company operates with a clear focus on quality over quantity, releasing carefully researched products that serve both as simulations and as digital preservation of aviation heritage.

## History

Restauravia was founded in France around 2008, initially developing aircraft for FSX. The company built their reputation by creating detailed reproductions of French aircraft that were otherwise unavailable in flight simulation.

Their early work included World War I-era aircraft and post-war trainers that had been largely ignored by other developers. As their reputation grew, they expanded to Prepar3D and eventually Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, bringing their French aviation expertise to each new platform.
