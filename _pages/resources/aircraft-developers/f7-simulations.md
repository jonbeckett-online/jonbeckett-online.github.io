## Overview

F7 Simulations is a specialized flight simulation developer focused on glider and sailplane simulation for Microsoft Flight Simulator. In a marketplace dominated by powered aircraft, F7 Simulations has carved out a dedicated niche serving the soaring community—pilots and enthusiasts who appreciate the pure art of motorless flight.

Their flagship product, the ASK 21 two-seat training glider, demonstrates their commitment to authentically recreating the soaring experience. F7 Simulations works to capture not just the aircraft themselves, but the unique flying characteristics and techniques that make gliding a distinct aviation discipline.

The company represents the growing recognition that MSFS's detailed weather and thermal simulation make it an excellent platform for glider simulation, and they are helping to develop this previously underserved market segment.

## History

F7 Simulations was founded in 2021, recognizing an opportunity to bring high-quality glider simulation to MSFS. The platform's advanced weather system, including thermals and ridge lift, created possibilities for authentic soaring simulation that hadn't been possible in earlier flight simulators.

The company focused their initial efforts on the ASK 21, a glider widely used for training soaring pilots around the world. This choice reflected both the aircraft's popularity and its accessibility to new glider pilots.
