## Overview

FlyInside began as a pioneering virtual reality solution for flight simulators and has evolved into a respected helicopter developer known for exceptional flight dynamics. Their tagline "The Real Helicopter Experience" reflects their dedication to producing accurate flight models that capture the nuances of real rotorcraft handling.

What distinguishes FlyInside's helicopters is their focus on physical accuracy over feature bloat. Their aircraft are built around carefully tuned flight dynamics that reflect real-world helicopter behavior—vortex ring state, retreating blade stall, translational lift, and other phenomena that separate casual helicopter simulations from serious ones. This approach has earned them a devoted following among pilots and enthusiasts who prioritize how a helicopter flies over how many buttons are in the cockpit.

The company leverages their VR heritage to ensure their helicopters perform exceptionally in virtual reality, making them popular choices for simmers who fly with headsets. Their cross-platform availability (MSFS, X-Plane, and their own FlyInside Flight Simulator) demonstrates their technical versatility.

## History

FlyInside was founded around 2015 by Dan Church, initially focused on bringing virtual reality capability to FSX and Prepar3D. Their VR add-on became hugely popular among flight simmers looking to experience cockpits in immersive 3D.

The company expanded into developing their own flight simulator (FlyInside Flight Simulator) with native VR support, but their helicopter add-ons became a significant part of their identity. The Bell 47G-2, one of aviation's most iconic training helicopters, was among their first aircraft and demonstrated their commitment to authentic flight modeling.

The Bell 206 JetRanger and RotorWay RW162F expanded their lineup to include both professional turbine helicopters and kit-built homebuilts. The addition of the JetExec and Gazelle 341 further diversified their offerings. Throughout their development history, FlyInside has maintained focus on flight dynamics quality over rapid product releases.

## Community Reputation

FlyInside helicopters are highly regarded by pilots and enthusiasts who prioritize realistic flight behavior. Their products may not have the most detailed cockpits or deepest systems simulation, but the flight dynamics are consistently praised as among the best in consumer flight simulation.

The Bell 47 is particularly popular as a challenge for pilots learning helicopter flying fundamentals—its responsive, demanding handling teaches proper technique. The Bell 206 offers a more modern experience while maintaining FlyInside's flight dynamics philosophy.

Pricing is reasonable, with products typically ranging from $30-40 individually. The RW162F/JetExec bundle offers good value for homebuilt enthusiasts. Support is provided through dedicated forums and direct communication with the developer. FlyInside is recommended for simmers who want to learn to fly helicopters properly rather than just manage systems.
