## Overview

Milviz (Military Visualizations) is a veteran flight simulation developer with roots dating back to 1990. The company has evolved from providing 3D models and animations for training environments, games, television, and film to becoming a respected developer of flight simulation aircraft for both consumer and professional markets.

Their motto, "quality or why bother," reflects an uncompromising approach to accuracy and detail. Milviz products are known for their realistic flight dynamics, detailed gauge and systems code, and authentic visual modeling. The company takes pride in having real-world pilots on their team who contribute not only to beta testing but also to developing flight dynamics and writing detailed product manuals.

In recent years, Milviz has expanded significantly into the professional training sector through their MilvizUSA division, providing high-fidelity simulations for military and commercial flight training programs.

## History

Milviz's journey began in 1990, initially focused on 3D visualization for various entertainment and training applications. The company transitioned into flight simulation add-ons, building a reputation for detailed military and general aviation aircraft.

Throughout the FSX and P3D era, Milviz established themselves as a go-to developer for unique aircraft that other developers wouldn't tackle. Their portfolio grew to include a mix of military trainers, warbirds, and general aviation aircraft.

More recently, Milviz has developed a substantial professional training division, creating simulations for the US military including the T-38, T-45C, T-6, F-15, F-16, KC-135, KC-10, and C-130J platforms.
