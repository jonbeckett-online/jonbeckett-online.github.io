## Overview

Lionheart Creations is an independent design firm that creates aircraft add-on packages for flight simulators, with a particular focus on unique and underrepresented aircraft types. The company philosophy emphasizes craftsmanship and attention to detail across their diverse portfolio, which ranges from classic piston singles to turboprops and experimental designs.

Beyond flight simulation, Lionheart Creations has worked with aircraft manufacturers on actual aircraft designs, bringing a real-world engineering perspective to their simulation work. This dual focus on virtual and physical aviation gives their products a unique grounding in practical design principles.

The company's instrument panels are noted for their clarity and functionality, reflecting the developer's understanding that pilots spend most of their time behind the gauges. Each aircraft is designed to be flown "by feel" with authentic handling characteristics that reward proper technique.

## History

Lionheart Creations Ltd. was established around 2005, growing from a small operation into a recognized name in the flight simulation community. The company built its reputation through FSX and P3D with a portfolio of aircraft spanning multiple categories.

With the release of MSFS 2020, Lionheart began updating their classic products and developing new aircraft for the platform. Recent work has focused on modernizing legacy designs like the Epic LT while bringing popular products like the Trinidad TB21 GT and Epic E1000 GX to the new simulator.

## Community Reputation

Lionheart Creations is appreciated for their willingness to tackle aircraft that other developers ignore. Their portfolio includes many "only available from Lionheart" options for simmers seeking unusual flying experiences. Product quality is generally well-regarded, particularly for visual modeling and cockpit design.

The company maintains a Facebook presence and YouTube channel for community engagement. Pricing is moderate, and products are available through multiple retailers. While not as widely discussed as some larger developers, Lionheart has a loyal following among pilots who value their unique aircraft selection and consistent quality across a diverse catalog.
