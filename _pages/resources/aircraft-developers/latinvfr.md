## Overview

LatinVFR is a flight simulation developer known for both airport scenery and aircraft development, with a particular focus on Latin American and Caribbean locations. While they built their early reputation on detailed airport sceneries for the Americas, LatinVFR has expanded into aircraft development with their Airbus series for Microsoft Flight Simulator.

The company's aircraft development division has brought a range of Airbus narrowbody and widebody aircraft to MSFS, providing alternatives to the default and other third-party Airbus offerings. Their experience creating detailed airport sceneries informs their understanding of the overall flight simulation experience.

LatinVFR serves as an important developer linking North and South America in flight simulation, with products that reflect the diverse aviation landscape of the Western Hemisphere.

## History

LatinVFR was founded in 2006, initially focusing on airport scenery development for FSX. Their detailed recreations of American airports, particularly in Florida, the Caribbean, and Latin America, established their reputation for quality and regional expertise.

As the company grew, they expanded to cover airports worldwide and ventured into aircraft development. The MSFS era saw LatinVFR make a significant push into aircraft with their Airbus product line, complementing their continued scenery development.
