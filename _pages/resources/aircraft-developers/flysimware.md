## Overview

FlySimWare is a veteran flight simulation developer with a clear passion for vintage and classic aircraft. Operating under the tagline "Fly the Vintage Skies," the company has spent over 15 years creating detailed simulations of aircraft from aviation's golden age, along with some modern classics that capture the spirit of hands-on flying.

What sets FlySimWare apart is their commitment to authenticity achieved through direct access to real aircraft. Many of their products are developed with input from actual owners who provide measurements, documentation, images, and even laser scans to ensure accuracy. This approach has produced some of the most detailed vintage aircraft available for flight simulation.

The company maintains an active community through Discord and Facebook, offering responsive support and regular engagement with their customer base. Their products appeal to pilots who appreciate the challenge and character of older aircraft with analog cockpits and manual systems.

## History

FlySimWare was established in 2008, initially focusing on tools, missions, and aircraft for Flight Simulator 9 and FSX. Over the years, they expanded their portfolio to include steam edition FSX and Prepar3D platforms.

With the release of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, FlySimWare brought several of their classic products to the new platform while developing new titles. Their access to real aircraft—including a team member who owns an actual C414AW Chancellor—has enabled a level of detail and accuracy that distinguishes their products.
