## Overview

Horizon Simulations is a community-driven development group that has undertaken one of the most ambitious freeware projects in MSFS history: a study-level Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner. Operating as a volunteer team rather than a commercial company, Horizon Simulations represents the collaborative spirit of the flight simulation community.

Their Boeing 787-9 project aims to deliver a comprehensive, systems-deep representation of Boeing's revolutionary composite airliner—entirely free of charge. This approach mirrors the philosophy of the FlyByWire A320 project, demonstrating that community developers can create products rivaling commercial offerings.

Horizon Simulations embodies the open-source, community-first ethos that has become an important part of the MSFS ecosystem alongside commercial development.

## History

Horizon Simulations was formed in 2021 by a group of passionate flight simulation enthusiasts and developers who saw the need for a quality Boeing 787 in MSFS. Rather than wait for commercial developers to fill the gap, they organized a volunteer team to create their own.

The project has progressed through multiple development milestones, with the team regularly sharing updates and early access versions with the community. Development has been transparent, with the team discussing challenges and gathering feedback throughout the process.
