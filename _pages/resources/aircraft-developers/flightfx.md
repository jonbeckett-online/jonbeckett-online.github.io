## Overview

FlightFX is an American flight simulation developer specializing in high-performance business jets and turboprops for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The company has positioned itself in the premium end of the market, focusing on aircraft that combine stunning visual quality with detailed systems simulation and exceptional performance modeling.

Their aircraft selection reflects a focus on speed and capability—from the .92 Mach Citation X to the distinctive Piaggio P180 Avanti and the innovative Honda HJet. FlightFX products are designed for pilots who want to fly fast, high, and in style, with the systems depth to make those flights engaging and realistic.

The company maintains an active Discord community where pilots can get support, share experiences, and stay informed about development updates and upcoming releases.

## History

FlightFX emerged in 2020 to develop aircraft for Microsoft Flight Simulator, quickly establishing themselves with the Marwan Gharibs HJet—a detailed simulation of the Honda Jet developed in collaboration with Marwan Gharib. This release demonstrated their commitment to quality and attention to detail.

The company has since expanded their portfolio with the Piaggio P180 Avanti and the Cessna Citation X, each representing a distinctive niche in the business aviation space. They've also developed airport scenery add-ons for the Chicago area.

FlightFX has earned a positive reputation for delivering well-executed business jets that combine visual polish with solid systems depth. The HJet particularly stands out as one of the better light jets available for the platform. 

The company is responsive through their Discord community and maintains good communication about development progress. Pricing is at the premium tier (around $25-30 USD), but customers generally feel the quality justifies the cost. For pilots interested in turbine aircraft with high performance capabilities, FlightFX products represent compelling options in an often-underserved segment of the market.
