## Overview

Orbx (Orbx Simulation Systems Pty Ltd) is one of the largest and most influential companies in the flight simulation industry. For over two decades, they have been "leading simulation" through their extensive catalog of scenery, airports, and aircraft, as well as their OrbxDirect marketplace that hosts products from over 120 partner developers.

While primarily known for their groundbreaking scenery products, Orbx has expanded into aircraft development and operates multiple business divisions including creative studios for entertainment and training simulations, the Volanta flight tracking application, and commercial solutions for enterprise clients.

Orbx's OrbxDirect platform has become one of the primary marketplaces for flight simulation content, hosting over 1,500 products across multiple platforms. Their partnerships with third-party developers have helped shape the modern flight simulation ecosystem.

## History

Orbx was founded in Australia in 2006, initially focusing on scenery development for FSX. Their early products revolutionized flight simulation scenery with unprecedented levels of detail and visual fidelity, particularly for regional Australian airports and landscapes.

The company grew steadily, expanding first to cover regions worldwide, then to additional platforms including Prepar3D and X-Plane. The launch of MSFS 2020 saw Orbx as one of the first major developers to release content for the new platform.

In recent years, Orbx has diversified beyond flight simulation, creating digital environments for entertainment franchises like Jurassic World, developing training and commercial simulation solutions, and expanding their marketplace to support developers industry-wide.
