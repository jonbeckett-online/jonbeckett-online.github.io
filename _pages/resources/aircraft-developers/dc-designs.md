## Overview

DC Designs is a United Kingdom-based flight simulation developer founded by Dean Crawford, specializing in military aircraft add-ons for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The studio has established itself as one of the most prolific producers of military jets for MSFS, with a portfolio spanning iconic fighters from multiple eras and nations.

Known for delivering visually impressive aircraft at accessible price points, DC Designs focuses on creating engaging flight experiences rather than study-level simulations. The developer maintains an active presence on social media and provides regular updates to existing products, though the pace of sim updates sometimes challenges their capacity for visual improvements.

DC Designs also operates SC Designs as a sister studio, which handles some aircraft projects including the F-16 Fighting Falcon.

## History

DC Designs emerged early in the MSFS 2020 era and quickly became a leading developer of military aircraft for the platform. The studio built its reputation with the Concorde and a series of classic American fighters, including the F-14 Tomcat and F-15 Eagle.

The 2023 roadmap marked an expansion into military transport aircraft with the C-5M Galaxy and C-17 Globemaster, responding to community demand for heavy lift aircraft—a category underrepresented in MSFS. Key milestones include the F-4 Phantom release and continued development of Eastern Bloc aircraft like the SU-27 Flanker.

## Community Reputation

DC Designs is generally well-regarded for producing attractive, fun-to-fly military aircraft at reasonable prices.

Dean Crawford's direct community engagement through social media is appreciated by customers. The studio's products are popular choices for simmers seeking military jet experiences without study-level complexity.
