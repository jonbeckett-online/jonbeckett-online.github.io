## Overview

RedWing Simulations is a German flight simulation developer known for creating some of the most unique and ambitious aircraft projects in the MSFS ecosystem. Rather than focusing on conventional aircraft, RedWing has made a name for themselves by bringing unusual and historically significant flying machines to the simulator—including airships, massive flying boats, and legendary airliners from aviation's golden age.

The company's flagship product, the Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation, represents their commitment to recreating complex, system-rich aircraft with extensive attention to detail. Their willingness to tackle unconventional subjects like the LZ 129 Hindenburg has earned them a devoted following among simmers who appreciate aviation history beyond the mainstream.

RedWing Simulations operates as a smaller development team, which allows them to pursue passion projects that larger studios might consider too niche for commercial viability.

## History

RedWing Simulations was established around 2020, coinciding with the release of Microsoft Flight Simulator. The company quickly distinguished itself by announcing ambitious projects that would bring rare aircraft types to the new simulator.

Their Hindenburg project attracted significant attention as one of the few attempts to accurately simulate airship flight in MSFS. The Super Constellation followed, representing one of the most complex piston-engine airliners ever built and challenging the team to recreate its intricate systems.
