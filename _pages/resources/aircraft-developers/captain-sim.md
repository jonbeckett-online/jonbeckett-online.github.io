## Overview

Captain Sim is one of the longest-running aircraft developers in the flight simulation industry, having operated continuously since 1999. The company specializes in commercial aircraft, particularly Boeing types, and has built a substantial catalog of airliners and military transport aircraft over their 25+ year history.

Known for their distinctive approach to aircraft development, Captain Sim products span from classic jets like the Boeing 707 to modern widebodies like the 777. They also developed one of the most detailed C-130 Hercules simulations available, appealing to both civilian and military aviation enthusiasts.

The company maintains an active community forum and has adapted to each new generation of flight simulation platforms while continuing to support their legacy products.

## History

Captain Sim was founded in 1999, during the FS98/FS2000 era, making them one of the original commercial flight simulation developers. Their early products established their focus on Boeing commercial aircraft.

Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, Captain Sim expanded their catalog to include various Boeing types, the L-1011 TriStar, and the C-130 Hercules. Each platform transition—from FS2004 to FSX to P3D—saw Captain Sim adapt their products and development processes.

The MSFS 2020 era brought both challenges and opportunities as Captain Sim worked to bring their expertise to the new platform while the community's expectations for systems depth continued to evolve.
