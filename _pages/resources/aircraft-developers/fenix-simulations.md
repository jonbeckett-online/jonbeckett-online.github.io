## Overview

Fenix Simulations burst onto the flight simulation scene with one mission: to create the most accurate and detailed Airbus A320 family simulation for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The company quickly established itself as the go-to developer for Airbus enthusiasts seeking study-level depth, competing directly with established players in the Airbus space.

What sets Fenix apart is their commitment to authentic Airbus systems simulation, including a custom-coded fly-by-wire system, accurate flight management computer, and realistic autopilot behavior. The aircraft includes a comprehensive Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) with real-world features and a sophisticated failure simulation system.

The development team includes individuals with real-world Airbus experience, which is evident in the attention to detail present throughout the aircraft. Fenix has built a strong community presence through their active Discord server, where developers regularly interact with users and provide development updates.

## History

Fenix Simulations was founded in 2020, timed to take advantage of the new Microsoft Flight Simulator platform. The team announced their A320 project and quickly generated significant buzz in the flight simulation community with regular development updates and previews.

The Fenix A320 was released in May 2022 to widespread acclaim, immediately positioning itself as the premium payware Airbus option for MSFS. The product received praise for its systems depth, flight model accuracy, and overall polish.

In 2023, Fenix expanded their A320 offering with the A319 and A321 expansion pack, providing users with the complete A320 family. The company has continued to update and improve their products, with ongoing development of features including VNAV improvements and system refinements.
