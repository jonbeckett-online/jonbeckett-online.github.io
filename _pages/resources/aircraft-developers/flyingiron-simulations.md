## Overview

FlyingIron Simulations is an Australian flight simulation studio founded by two brothers based in Sydney. The team brings together expertise in 3D game art and sound design, with self-taught programming skills developed over years of aircraft development. Their passion for military aviation—particularly World War II warbirds—drives every project.

FlyingIron has established themselves as the premier developer of WWII fighter aircraft for Microsoft Flight Simulator, with a focus on authentic recreations of legendary Allied and Axis fighters. Their aircraft are characterized by exceptional visual quality, immersive sound design, and flight models that capture the unique character of each airframe.

The studio's cross-platform presence across MSFS, X-Plane, and DCS World demonstrates their technical versatility and commitment to reaching the widest possible audience of warbird enthusiasts.

## History

FlyingIron began developing aircraft for X-Plane 11, where early releases including the P-47N Thunderbolt and G109B motorglider established their quality standards. The transition to MSFS 2020 coincided with the simulator's launch, positioning them to become a leading warbird developer for the new platform.

The Spitfire L.F Mk IXc was among their early MSFS releases and remains one of the defining warbirds for the platform. Subsequent releases have expanded their WWII coverage to include American, British, and German fighters. The studio also maintains DCS World development, with the A-7E Corsair II in progress.

Regular updates to existing products demonstrate their commitment to continuous improvement and platform compatibility.
