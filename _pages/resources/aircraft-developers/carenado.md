## Overview

Specializing in high-quality models of real-world GA aircraft, Carenado has earned a reputation for consistently delivering visually stunning aircraft with attention to exterior and interior detail. Their focus is on creating "simplified flight experience simulation but very close to reality."

The company maintains a warm, approachable relationship with customers and employs highly trained professional staff using state-of-the-art equipment and technology. Carenado has adapted successfully to each major flight simulator platform, maintaining one of the largest catalogs of GA aircraft in the simulation market.

## History

Founded in 2005, Carenado emerged from Mexico's growing software development scene to become a major player in flight simulation. The company established itself during the FSX era and has since become synonymous with quality general aviation aircraft. They've successfully transitioned through multiple simulator generations, from FSX to P3D to X-Plane and now MSFS.

Throughout their history, Carenado has focused exclusively on general aviation and light commercial aircraft, establishing a niche that they've come to dominate. Their consistent release schedule and quality standards have made them a reliable choice for simmers seeking variety in their virtual hangars.

## Community Reputation

Carenado is known for producing visually beautiful aircraft with good external modeling and interior texturing. They're appreciated for offering a wide variety of GA aircraft at reasonable price points. Some community members note that their systems modeling tends toward "study-lite" rather than full simulation depth, making their aircraft accessible to casual simmers but potentially less satisfying for those seeking highly accurate systems. Support responsiveness has varied over the years, though the company maintains an active Zendesk support portal. Overall, Carenado is considered a solid choice for simmers wanting attractive, flyable GA aircraft without steep learning curves.
