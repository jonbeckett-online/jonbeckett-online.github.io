# Airbus A310

## The Real Aircraft

The Airbus A310 is a wide-body twin-engine jetliner that was the second aircraft type produced by Airbus. A shortened derivative of the A300, it proved that Airbus could compete in the international market and pioneered technologies used in later Airbus designs.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Manufacturer:** Airbus
- **First Flight:** April 3, 1982
- **Introduction:** April 1983 (Lufthansa/Swissair)
- **Type:** Twin-engine wide-body airliner
- **Engines:** 2× GE CF6-80 or PW JT9D-7R4 (48,000-59,000 lbf)
- **Cruise Speed:** Mach 0.80 (860 km/h)
- **Range:** 9,600 km (5,200 nmi) A310-300
- **Passengers:** 200-280

The A310 introduced many innovations including the first two-crew glass cockpit for a wide-body and advanced composite materials. Though production ended in 2007, several remain in service with cargo operators and governments.
