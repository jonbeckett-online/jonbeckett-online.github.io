# Boeing P-26A Peashooter

## The Real Aircraft

The Boeing P-26 Peashooter was the first all-metal monoplane fighter produced for the United States Army Air Corps and the first to enter regular squadron service. Though obsolescent by WWII, it represented a revolutionary step in American fighter design.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Manufacturer:** Boeing
- **First Flight:** March 20, 1932
- **Introduction:** December 1933
- **Type:** Single-seat fighter
- **Engine:** Pratt & Whitney R-1340-27 Wasp (600 hp)
- **Max Speed:** 377 km/h (234 mph)
- **Range:** 579 km (360 miles)
- **Armament:** 2× .30 cal or .50 cal machine guns

The P-26 was affectionately nicknamed "Peashooter" for its small, cylindrical fuselage. While considered obsolete when WWII began, P-26s in Philippine service did engage Japanese aircraft in December 1941, scoring several victories. Only a handful of precious P-26s survive today.
