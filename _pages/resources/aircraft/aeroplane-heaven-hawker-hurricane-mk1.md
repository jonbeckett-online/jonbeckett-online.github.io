# Hawker Hurricane Mk.I

## The Real Aircraft

The Hawker Hurricane was a British single-seat fighter aircraft that became famous during the Battle of Britain. Often overshadowed by the Spitfire, Hurricanes actually accounted for 60% of RAF air victories during the battle and formed the backbone of Fighter Command.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Manufacturer:** Hawker Aircraft
- **First Flight:** November 6, 1935
- **Introduction:** December 1937
- **Type:** Single-seat fighter
- **Engine:** Rolls-Royce Merlin III (1,030 hp)
- **Max Speed:** 547 km/h (340 mph)
- **Range:** 965 km (600 miles)
- **Armament:** 8× .303 Browning machine guns

Over 14,500 Hurricanes were built, serving in every theater of WWII. While less glamorous than the Spitfire, the Hurricane was more rugged, easier to repair, and absolutely essential to Britain's survival in 1940. Its fabric-covered construction meant battle damage could often be patched in the field.
