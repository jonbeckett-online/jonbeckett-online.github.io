# SOCATA Rallye MS-893

## The Real Aircraft

The Rallye is a French light aircraft family manufactured by SOCATA, known for excellent short-field performance thanks to its full-span leading-edge slats and slotted flaps. The MS-893 is a four-seat version popular for touring and training.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Manufacturer:** SOCATA (Morane-Saulnier)
- **First Flight:** 1959 (Rallye series)
- **Type:** Four-seat touring aircraft
- **Engine:** Lycoming O-360 (180 hp)
- **Cruise Speed:** 225 km/h (140 mph)
- **Range:** 1,000 km (620 miles)
- **Ceiling:** 4,570 m (15,000 ft)

The Rallye's STOL performance comes from automatic leading-edge slats that deploy at low speeds, combined with large slotted flaps. This makes it forgiving during slow flight and landing, ideal for training and short strips. Over 3,300 Rallyes were built.
