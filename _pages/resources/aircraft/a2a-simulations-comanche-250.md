## The Real Aircraft

The Piper PA-24 Comanche was a single-engine, low-wing monoplane produced by Piper Aircraft from 1957 to 1972. It represented a significant departure from Piper's traditional fabric-covered designs, featuring an all-metal construction and retractable tricycle landing gear.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Manufacturer:** Piper Aircraft
- **First Flight:** 1956
- **Introduction:** 1958
- **Type:** Four-seat touring aircraft
- **Engine:** Lycoming O-540 (250 hp)
- **Cruise Speed:** 290 km/h (180 mph)
- **Range:** 2,000 km (1,240 miles)
- **Ceiling:** 6,100 m (20,000 ft)

The Comanche 250 was the most popular variant, offering an excellent balance of speed, range, and payload. Its sleek design, retractable gear, and powerful engine made it a favorite among pilots who wanted serious cross-country capability. Production ended in 1972 after flooding destroyed Piper's Lock Haven factory, with over 4,800 aircraft built.
