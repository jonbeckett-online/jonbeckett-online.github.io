## The Real Aircraft

The BAe 146 is a British short-haul regional airliner known for its exceptional short-field performance and quiet operation, earning it the nickname "Whisper Jet." Its four high-bypass turbofan engines gave it unmatched capability from challenging airports.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Manufacturer:** British Aerospace
- **First Flight:** September 3, 1981
- **Introduction:** May 1983
- **Type:** Four-engine regional jet
- **Engines:** 4× Avco Lycoming ALF 502R-5 (6,970 lbf each)
- **Cruise Speed:** 767 km/h (414 kts)
- **Range:** 2,909 km (1,571 nmi)
- **Passengers:** 70-112

The BAe 146 could operate from airports where larger jets couldn't go—London City, Florence, and countless others with short runways or noise restrictions. It was also adopted by the Royal Air Force and serves as The Queen's Flight CC.2. Production ended in 1993, but many continue in service.
