# Supermarine Spitfire Mk.IXc

## The Real Aircraft

The Spitfire Mk.IX was the most produced Spitfire variant, developed as an urgent response to the Fw 190. It mated the Spitfire VIII airframe with the powerful two-stage supercharged Merlin 61, restoring RAF air superiority.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Manufacturer:** Supermarine
- **First Flight:** 1942
- **Introduction:** June 1942
- **Type:** Single-seat fighter
- **Engine:** Rolls-Royce Merlin 61/63/66 (1,565-1,720 hp)

- **Range:** 980 km (610 miles) with drop tank
- **Armament:** 2× 20mm Hispano cannon, 4× .303 Browning (c-wing)

The Mk.IX's two-stage supercharger gave it exceptional high-altitude performance, making it a match for any German fighter. Over 5,600 were built, and it served on every front from D-Day to the Far East. The c-wing variant combined cannons and machine guns for maximum firepower.
