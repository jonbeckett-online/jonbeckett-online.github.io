## The Real Aircraft

The Airbus A320 is a single-aisle, twin-engine jetliner that pioneered fly-by-wire technology in commercial aviation. Since its introduction in 1988, the A320 family has become one of the most successful aircraft programs in history.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Manufacturer:** Airbus
- **First Flight:** February 22, 1987
- **Introduction:** March 28, 1988 (Air France)
- **Type:** Twin-engine narrow-body airliner
- **Engines:** 2× CFM56-5 or IAE V2500 (24,000-27,000 lbf)
- **Cruise Speed:** Mach 0.78 (840 km/h)
- **Range:** 6,100 km (3,300 nmi)
- **Passengers:** 150-180

The A320 was the first commercial aircraft to use digital fly-by-wire flight control as standard, allowing for flight envelope protection. This technology became standard across all modern Airbus types.
