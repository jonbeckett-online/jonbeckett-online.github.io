# Ted Smith Aerostar 600

## The Real Aircraft

The Ted Smith Aerostar 600 is an American twin-engine, low-wing aircraft known for being the fastest piston twin ever produced. Designed by Ted R. Smith (formerly of Aero Commander), the Aerostar combined exceptional speed with distinctive "mid-wing" aesthetics.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Designer:** Ted R. Smith
- **First Flight:** 1966
- **Type:** Twin-engine piston aircraft
- **Engines:** 2× Lycoming IO-540 (290 hp each)
- **Cruise Speed:** 426 km/h (265 mph) - fastest piston twin
- **Range:** 2,400 km (1,500 miles)
- **Ceiling:** 7,620 m (25,000 ft)
- **Passengers:** 5-6

The Aerostar's speed came from its clean aerodynamic design, including a unique mid-wing configuration and small frontal area. While demanding to fly due to its high wing loading and approach speeds, experienced pilots praised its sports-car-like handling and blistering cruise performance.
