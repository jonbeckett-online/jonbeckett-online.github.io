# Hawker Nimrod & Fury

## The Real Aircraft

The Hawker Fury and its naval variant, the Nimrod, were British biplane fighters of the early 1930s. The Fury was the first RAF fighter capable of exceeding 200 mph in level flight, while the Nimrod served aboard Royal Navy carriers.

### Hawker Fury
- **First Flight:** March 25, 1929
- **Service:** RAF, 1931-1939
- **Engine:** Rolls-Royce Kestrel IIS (525 hp)
- **Max Speed:** 333 km/h (207 mph)
- **Armament:** 2× .303 Vickers machine guns

### Hawker Nimrod
- **First Flight:** 1930
- **Service:** Fleet Air Arm, 1932-1941
- **Engine:** Rolls-Royce Kestrel IIMS (477 hp)
- **Max Speed:** 314 km/h (195 mph)
- **Features:** Carrier arresting hook, flotation gear

Both aircraft represented the pinnacle of biplane fighter development and featured the elegant lines characteristic of Sydney Camm's designs. They served as frontline fighters until monoplane types like the Hurricane (also designed by Camm) replaced them.
