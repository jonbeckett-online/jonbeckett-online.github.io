# Republic P-47D Thunderbolt

## The Real Aircraft

The Republic P-47 Thunderbolt was the largest, heaviest, and most expensive single-engine fighter of World War II. Nicknamed the "Jug" (short for Juggernaut), its rugged construction and massive firepower made it one of the war's most effective fighter-bombers.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Manufacturer:** Republic Aviation
- **First Flight:** May 6, 1941
- **Introduction:** 1942
- **Type:** Single-seat fighter-bomber
- **Engine:** Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp (2,535 hp)
- **Max Speed:** 697 km/h (433 mph)
- **Range:** 2,012 km (1,250 miles) with drop tanks
- **Armament:** 8× .50 cal machine guns, up to 2,500 lb bombs/rockets

The P-47 was the USAAF's primary fighter from 1943. Over 15,600 were built, more than any other U.S. fighter. Its air-cooled radial engine and massive construction allowed it to absorb tremendous battle damage and bring pilots home. P-47s claimed over 3,000 air victories and destroyed countless ground targets.
