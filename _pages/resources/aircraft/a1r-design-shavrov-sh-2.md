**Key Specifications:**
- **Designer:** Vadim Shavrov
- **First Flight:** 1930
- **Type:** Two-seat amphibious flying boat

Over 700 Sh-2 aircraft were built between 1932 and 1939, serving with Aeroflot, the Soviet Air Force, and various civilian operators. Its robust construction, amphibious capability, and reliability made it invaluable in the remote regions of Siberia and the Far East where runways were scarce but lakes and rivers abundant.
