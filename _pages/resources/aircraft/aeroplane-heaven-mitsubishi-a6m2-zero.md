# Mitsubishi A6M2 "Zero"

## The Real Aircraft

The Mitsubishi A6M "Zero" was Japan's primary carrier-based fighter throughout World War II. Its exceptional range and maneuverability made it the most famous Japanese aircraft of the war, dominating the skies during the early Pacific conflict.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Manufacturer:** Mitsubishi
- **First Flight:** April 1, 1939
- **Introduction:** July 1940
- **Type:** Single-seat carrier fighter
- **Engine:** Nakajima NK1C Sakae 12 (940 hp)
- **Max Speed:** 533 km/h (331 mph)
- **Range:** 3,105 km (1,929 miles) — exceptional for the era
- **Armament:** 2× 20mm cannon, 2× 7.7mm machine guns

The Zero achieved its legendary agility and range through weight savings that compromised pilot protection and self-sealing fuel tanks. Over 10,000 were built in various versions. While dominant early in the war, the Zero was outclassed by newer Allied fighters by 1943.
