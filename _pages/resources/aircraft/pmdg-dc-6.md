**Key Specifications:**
- **Manufacturer:** Douglas Aircraft Company
- **First Flight:** February 15, 1946
- **Introduction:** March 1947 (United Air Lines)
- **Type:** Four-engine propliner

## The Simulation

The **PMDG DC-6** was PMDG's first product for Microsoft Flight Simulator and set a new standard for radial engine simulation.

**Features:**
- **Complete Radial Engine Management:** Mixture, prop, throttle, cowl flaps—all the complexity of real piston operations
- **Authentic Systems:** Hydraulics, pressurization, electrical—all modeled in depth
- **Period Navigation:** Use pre-jet era navigation techniques
- **Full Crew Operations:** Flight engineer station fully functional
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Real DC-6 pilot manuals included
- **Compatible with MSFS 2020/2024**
