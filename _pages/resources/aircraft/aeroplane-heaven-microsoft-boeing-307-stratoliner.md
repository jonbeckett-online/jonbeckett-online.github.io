# Boeing 307 Stratoliner

## The Real Aircraft

The Boeing 307 Stratoliner was the world's first commercial transport aircraft with a pressurized cabin, allowing it to fly above weather at high altitudes. Built in the late 1930s, it represented a revolutionary leap in commercial aviation technology.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Manufacturer:** Boeing
- **First Flight:** December 31, 1938
- **Introduction:** July 1940
- **Type:** Four-engine pressurized airliner
- **Engines:** 4× Wright GR-1820 Cyclone (1,100 hp each)
- **Cruise Speed:** 354 km/h (220 mph)
- **Range:** 3,846 km (2,390 miles)
- **Passengers:** 33
- **Ceiling:** 7,992 m (26,200 ft)

Only 10 Stratoliners were built before WWII halted production. The aircraft shared its wings and tail with the B-17 Flying Fortress. TWA and Pan Am operated them on transcontinental routes. One restored Stratoliner survives at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum.
