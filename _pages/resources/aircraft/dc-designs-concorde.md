# Aerospatiale-BAC Concorde

## The Real Aircraft

The Concorde was a turbojet-powered supersonic passenger airliner developed jointly by British and French manufacturers. It remains the only successful supersonic commercial aircraft, revolutionizing transatlantic travel with its Mach 2 speeds.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Manufacturers:** Aerospatiale / British Aircraft Corporation
- **First Flight:** March 2, 1969
- **Introduction:** January 21, 1976
- **Retired:** November 26, 2003
- **Type:** Supersonic passenger airliner
- **Engines:** 4× Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593 (38,050 lbf with reheat)
- **Cruise Speed:** Mach 2.04 (2,180 km/h) at 60,000 ft
- **Range:** 7,223 km (3,900 nmi)
- **Passengers:** 92-128

Concorde could cross the Atlantic in under 3.5 hours, arriving in New York before departing London due to the time difference. Only 20 were built, of which 14 entered service with British Airways and Air France. Concorde remained the pinnacle of commercial aviation speed until its retirement.
