# Boeing 777-200ER

## The Real Aircraft

The Boeing 777-200ER (Extended Range) is a wide-body twin-engine jetliner that revolutionized long-haul air travel. It proved that twin-engine aircraft could safely cross oceans, opening ETOPS routes previously restricted to three and four-engine aircraft.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Manufacturer:** Boeing
- **First Flight:** October 7, 1996
- **Introduction:** February 1997 (British Airways)
- **Type:** Twin-engine wide-body airliner
- **Engines:** 2× GE90 or PW4000 or Trent 800 (93,400-99,040 lbf)
- **Cruise Speed:** Mach 0.84 (905 km/h)
- **Range:** 13,080 km (7,065 nmi)
- **Passengers:** 301-440
- **Wingspan:** 60.9 m (199 ft 11 in)

The 777 was the first Boeing aircraft designed entirely on computer and the first commercial jet to use fly-by-wire controls. Its exceptional reliability and economics made it the backbone of long-haul fleets worldwide.
