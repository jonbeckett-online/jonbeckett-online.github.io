# Grumman F3F-2

## The Real Aircraft

The Grumman F3F was the last biplane fighter delivered to the United States Navy. Entering service in 1936, it was the culmination of Grumman's barrel-fuselage biplane fighter line and served aboard carriers until replaced by the monoplane F4F Wildcat.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Manufacturer:** Grumman Aircraft
- **First Flight:** March 1935
- **Introduction:** 1936
- **Type:** Single-seat carrier fighter
- **Engine:** Wright R-1820-22 Cyclone (950 hp)
- **Max Speed:** 418 km/h (260 mph)
- **Range:** 1,609 km (1,000 miles)
- **Armament:** 1× .50 cal, 1× .30 cal machine gun

The F3F's distinctive compact, barrel-shaped fuselage housed a massive radial engine that gave it exceptional performance for a biplane. Though obsolete before the war, F3Fs trained many of the pilots who would fly their monoplane successors into combat.
