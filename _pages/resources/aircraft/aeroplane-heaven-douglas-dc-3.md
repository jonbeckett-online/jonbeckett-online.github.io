# Douglas DC-3

## The Real Aircraft

The Douglas DC-3 is arguably the most significant aircraft in aviation history. First flying in 1935, it revolutionized commercial air travel and later proved indispensable in World War II as the military C-47 Skytrain. Many still fly today, nearly 90 years after the first flight.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Manufacturer:** Douglas Aircraft Company
- **First Flight:** December 17, 1935
- **Type:** Twin-engine transport
- **Engines:** 2× Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp (1,200 hp each)
- **Cruise Speed:** 333 km/h (207 mph)
- **Range:** 2,400 km (1,500 miles)
- **Passengers:** 21-32
- **Crew:** 2-3

Over 16,000 DC-3s and C-47s were built. The aircraft made commercial aviation profitable for the first time and carried troops and supplies across every theater of WWII. General Eisenhower called it one of the four most important tools of the war. Remarkably, several hundred remain in commercial service worldwide.
