For less than the price of a coffee from Starbucks you can grab a copy of the short-cut functional procedure I have written for your favourite aircraft.

The procedures typically include short-cut keyboard combinations to navigate around the cockpit, and brief notes on where to look while working through pre-flight, engine start, taxi and take-off. The procedures are functional - purposely omitting many of the tests a real crew would perform, while retaining the steps required by the simulated aircraft.

I update the procedures as aircraft evolve (and as I can find time to do so) - and will post about the updates, so it's worth [subscribing by email](https://jonbeckett.substack.com/subscribe) for updates.
