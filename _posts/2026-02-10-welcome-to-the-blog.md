Hello, and welcome to my corner of the internet!

I'm Jonathan—a software developer by day and virtual pilot by... well, every other available moment. When I'm not wrestling with corporate codebases, you'll find me attempting to fly all manner of simulated aircraft in a questionably correct manner.

**Disclaimer:** I'm not a real pilot. The virtual skies are safer that way.

## What's This Site About?

This site is a place for me to share resources related to flight simulation.

But if you want to see me *actually* flying (and occasionally crashing) virtual aircraft, you'll want to head over to my main hangouts:

## Watch on YouTube

I share my flight simulation adventures with nearly **50,000 fellow virtual aviators** on YouTube. You'll find:

- **Livestreams** — Join me in real-time as I fly routes around the world
- **First looks** — New aircraft add-ons and what I think of them
- **Tutorials** — Startup procedures, systems walkthroughs, and tips
- **Community flights** — Flying with viewers and the wider sim community

## Subscribe for Email Updates

For those who prefer reading, I write a regular blog on **Substack** where I document my flight simulation escapades. Over **1,800 subscribers** already receive updates straight to their inbox—completely free.

You'll get:

- Stories from my virtual flying adventures

## Support the Channel

If you'd like to support what I do, you can grab my **startup procedures and guides** for various aircraft on Ko-Fi. I've created detailed procedures for aircraft including:

- Airbus A310, A350
- Boeing 737, 777
- MD-11
- Eurofighter Typhoon
- And many more...

There's also the popular **Garmin G1000 Flight Plan Programming Quick Reference** that's helped hundreds of virtual pilots.
